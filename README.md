# Neovim Config

:wave: Hi! This is my Neovim configuration: feel free to copy as much from it as you like!

You're also always welcome to ask me questions about my configuration on stream, or open an issue in the repository to do the same.


### Aside

Note that this _was_ originally by regular ol' `.vimrc` file that I ported to Neovim and have customized it from there. That said, a lot
of it is still a holdover from that original file so there's a mix of `vimscript` and `lua` in play here.
