- [ ] Save / Store 1 item for the next run
    - I had an idea that we would allow players to save 1 item per run to be able to "pass" it onto
      their next character. The in-world explanation for this would be some sort of mirror/portal
      that appears in one of the early towns. It could feature a description as follows:
      
      "As you approach the shimmering mirror you notice that the reflection is you... and not you.
      Nearing the surface, you notice the shimmering figure seems to be offering you something.
      However, as you reach out your hand the figure pulls away. You surmise that it's not
      offering a gift... instead, it wants to _trade_.
      
      [1] - Hand over an item.
      [2] - Walk away.
      
      When you trade an item over, the figure will in turn trade you _the last item you traded_ to
      it. I should also make the _first_ instance of this trade reward you in some way so that the
      player is encouraged to try it again on subsequent runs because the purpose of the mirror
      won't become clear until the second usage at the earliest.
